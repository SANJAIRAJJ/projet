    Samsung Galaxy smartphones run the Android operating system under the Google Mobile Services platform,
    however Samsung and third-parties have bundled various other software in them too. 
    The TouchWiz interface was used until 2017, replaced by Samsung Experience. 
    This was then replaced by One UI in 2019.
    The company has created many apps and services under the Galaxy brand specifically for these devices - many of which come preloaded - including the Galaxy Store which provides apps and customizations. Since late 2019, several Microsoft apps like Outlook also come preloaded[21] on Galaxy as a result of a Samsung-Microsoft partnership.[22][
